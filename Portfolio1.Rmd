#The methods - boring stuff
#Define hypothesis
#explain experiment
#Describe participants: how many

#GITHUB!!! 
#2 documents to submit: 1) visual search exp 2)social engagement
#methods/results/

#git git
#Methods: data collection. what's important?
#which eyetracker was used, sampling rate, lighting and participant's position, participants (which eye, exclusion criteria < major than 2 degrees error, special things< glasses, lenses, e.g. average error 0.87degrees), calibration process, system used and measures, integration with stimulus presentation

#Methods: data pre-processing
#velocity, event detection, artifacts (what was conbsidered artifacts, what was removed< explain!!), sampling/averaging of data, if present quality check, drift check/drift correction

#Methods: Data analysis
#measures used, models used, model selection (report rmse)/validity check, quality<the diff between prediction of the model and actual data, STATISTICAL SOFTWARE

# intercept< 1*beta zero or 2*beta zero
#coefficient (estimate from the model)< beta one

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
