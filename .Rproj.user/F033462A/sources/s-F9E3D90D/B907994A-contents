#Conceptual -> computational/functional hypothesis, generalized
#Operational -> algorithmic -> interprentation of the variables
#Implementational -> R code


#Conceptual plane. Visual search: 
#           Visual search patterns are affected by task structure and goals (top-down)
#           Visual serach patterns are affected by stimulus structure (bottom-down)
#           Search direction is affected by cultural constraints

#Conceptual plane. Social engagement. 
#           More emotionally engaged when involved in interaction (~direction and ostensiveness)
#           Direction affects participant attention
#           More focus on person vs cup when interaction is lead by eye contact
#           Sexual preferences
#           Familiarity effect


#Operational plane.Visual search:
#           Fixation, duration, position (spatial dispersion)
#           Saccades amplitude, number of saccades, next jump=long jump, direction

#Operational plane.Social engagement. concept: More emotionally enagged when involved in interaction (~direction and ostensiveness)
#           Pupil size (Time, Lighting, Fixations and in Saccadaes?)
#           Fixation duration
